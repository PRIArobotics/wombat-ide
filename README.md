- add links to useful resources, such as firmware, schematics, specifications
- write documentation for common issues, such as connecting via SSH, working with VS Code or git, or common code snippets
- write scripts and tools to automate common tasks, such as for deployment and cross-compilation
- share your experiences with using these tools using issues and pull requests, to gradually extend and improve these resources
